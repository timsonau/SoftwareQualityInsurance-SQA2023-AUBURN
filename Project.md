## Project for Software Quality Assurance (CSC 5710/6710) 

### Objective 

The objective of this project is to integrate software quality assurance activities into an existing Python project. Whatever we learned from our workshops will be integrated in the project. 

### Activities 

1. Unpack the project `KubeSec.zip`. (1%)
2. Upload project as a GitHub repo on `github.com`. Format of the repo name is `TEAMNAME-SQA2023-AUBURN`  (2%)
3. In your project repo create `README.md` listing your team name and team members. (2%)
4. Apply the following activities related to software quality assurance:

   - 4.a. Create a Git Hook that will run and report all security weaknesses in the project in a CSV file whenever a Python file is changed and committed. (30%)

   - 4.b. Create a `fuzz.py` file that will automatically fuzz 5 Python methods of your choice. Report any bugs you discovered by the `fuzz.py` file. `fuzz.py` will be automatically executed from GitHub actions. (30%)

   - 4.c. Integrate forensics by modifying 5 Python methods of your choice. (30%)

5. Report your activities and lessons learned (5%)   

### Deliverables 

1. A repo hosted on GitHub. Name of the repo will be `TEAMNAME-SQA2022-AUBURN` 
2. Full completion of all activities as recorded on the GitHub repository 
3. Report describing what activities your performed and what you have learned 
4. Logs/screenshots that show execution of forensics, fuzzing, and static analysis
